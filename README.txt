"Typle out" is a dice game that allows players to compete in order to reach a target score which in this case is 50 points. This can be reached by rolling three dices and 
avoiding a "tuple out" (rolling three of the same number). The first player to reach the target score will be the winner. 

The game would first give a message welcoming the player into the game. It will later ask the player to enter a name and respond with a message that states that the game is 
starting along with the name entered. It then will allow the user to roll three dices, if the outcome of the rolls is all three different numbers the game would give the 
player the option to either continue rolling or end their turn. If they do decide to end their turn, it will add up all the three numbers rolled and take that as the final 
score for the player. Although, if the player decides to keep rolling until they either get "tupled out" (rolling three of the same number) which they will end their turn 
with 0 points or until they want to end their game with whatever point they have. These same rules would apply for the computr turn. If at any point the player or computer 
rolls two of the same numbers those two numbers will be fixed and the player would only have the choice to reroll the number that is different.
